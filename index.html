<p class="aboutme">Hi, I'm Blaine Lambert. I was born in Florida, but have lived all over the entire east side of the states.<br>
                    I finished fourth though twelfth grade at Pine Grove High School. I moved out and now live in<br>
                    Water Valley, Mississippi for schooling at Base Camp Coding Academy. I was one of the lucky few this<br>
                    year to make it into the program. After this single year, I look forward in starting my career if it ends<br>
                    up being a great fit for me. My skills include, PC diagnostics and repair, PC building, and graphic design. I also have two national certifications from TestOut, Fundamentals Pro and Networking Pro 2<br>
                    with cyber security.</p>
<p class="projectdesc">These projects are programs where used everything<br>
                        we learned here at <a href="https://basecampcodingacademy.org/">Base Camp Coding Academy</a>.<br>
                        TicTacToe was a solo project for unit two,<br>
                        We used everything we knew about python. It is<br>
                        a simple game meant for you and a friend to play.<br>
                        The other game labeled McDonalds was for unit one<br>
                        where we worked teams of four, It is meant to simulate<br>
                        a trip inside McDonalds where you can explore,<br>
                        order food, and use a TV.</p>
